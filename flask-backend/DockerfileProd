# NOTE: This is just kinda the approach that I would take for prod, some adjustments/improvements might be needed 

# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Install Gunicorn
RUN pip install gunicorn

# Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8000

# Define environment variables
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_ENV=production  
# or development, as needed

# Run the application using Gunicorn
CMD ["gunicorn", "-b", "0.0.0.0:8000", "app:app"]
